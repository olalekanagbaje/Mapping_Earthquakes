# Mapping_Earthquakes
To create an interactive map that displays important geological data about earthquakes around the world in relation to the tectonic plates locations of the earth

### Overview of the Mapping_Earthquake Challenge

The purpose of this work / challenge is to create an interactive map that displays data about earthquakes around the world in relation to the tectonic plates locations of the earth. Specifically, this work invoved;

  1. Creating an interactive map about earthquakes around the world with 3 tile layers (streets, satellite-street & dark)
  2. Adding tectonic plates, earthquakes & major earthquakes data as overlay to the map
  3. Adding major earthquakes (those with magnitude greater than 4.5) data also as an overlay to the map


To generate these analysis, I utilized the following resources;

  - Data Sources: 
    1. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

    2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

    3. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson

  - Softwares: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, VS Code, leaflet.js, D3, Mapbox.
